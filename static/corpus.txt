The use of artificial intelligence in aerial vehicles will change the world more than we can imagine. We want to pioneer the usage development of this technology for good. Our ultimate aim is to develop a drone that is capable of autonomously delivering life-saving medicine to people who need it urgently, as well as to develop microrobots capable of self-assembly and function in space, which we are currently prototyping. Working up to these goals, we will grow our experience with a number of minor projects such as building face-tracking selfie drones, body-posture controlled drones, and simpler forms of self-assembly/swarms. We plan to use IBM Watson, TensorFlow/Keras, Python, and C++, although we may change this based on specific technological requirements. Previous experience in machine learning is not necessary, but a good background in Python or other high level programming language is. Working on this project will show colleges (or anything you apply to) that you are capable of working in a professional setting on advanced technology, and you are capable of creating real-world products that have national or even international significance.
